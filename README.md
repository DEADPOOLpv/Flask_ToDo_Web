# Flash ToDo List with MySQL Backend and Login.

This application is a web-based to-do list written using Flash (perhaps in conjunction with ActionScript) that uses a MySQL database for data storage. It provides a login system for managing user accounts and related operations.

## Key features:

- Task Management: Users may add, view, update, and remove tasks from their own lists.
- MySQL Backend: The programme saves and retrieves task data in a MySQL database, ensuring that data is retained even when the user quits the browser.
- Login System: To access their personal ToDo lists, users must first register and log in using their username and password. This prevents unauthorised access while also allowing various users to have independent task lists.
